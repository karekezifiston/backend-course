Asynchronous operations and worker threads
Optimizing server response time


27. Deployment and Production Setup
Preparing your app for production (configurations, optimizations)
Deploying on cloud services (Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS)
Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar tools
Using PM2 for process management and monitoring
Logging and error tracking in production


29. Building a Project (Capstone Project)
Setting up a project from scratch (e.g., e-commerce, blog, or social media backend)
Designing the API structure and database schema
Implementing all CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization
Adding extra features (e.g., file upload, real-time chat, etc.)
Deploying the project to a production server
Documenting your API with Swagger or Postman
